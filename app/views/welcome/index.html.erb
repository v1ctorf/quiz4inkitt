    <h1>Quiz by victorf</h1>
    <p>A small tool that does the following:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Shows to a user a simple Quiz, that has 5 questions as 5 separate pages, shown one after another.</li>
        <li>Each question will have 2-5 predefined answers that user can pick from, open answers are not possible.</li>
        <li>After the quiz user should see the results page with answers distribution for each question from all users who completed the quiz (answered all 5 questions).</li>
        <li>The user should not be able to access next question without answering current, or going back to previous questions.</li>
        <li>No login for users should be required.The user should be able to do the quiz only once (We expect that users always use default browser settings and don't use incognito).</li>
    </ol>
